A Firefox / Greasemonkey Add-On that enhances IMDb with data from Clipland.

## DESCRIPTION

The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an invaluable resource for information about
feature films, while on the other hand, it is not as complete when it comes
short films. Music videos and TV commercials mostly are not covered at imdb at
all. This, in turn, is where Clipland's expertise lies. So it's a no-brainer to combine
the two sites:

- [This script on Add-On for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imdb-clipland/)
- [Script Homepage](https://www.clipland.com/imdbclipland)
